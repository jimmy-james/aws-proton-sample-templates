## Description

This template is compatible with the [fargate-env](../../environment-templates/fargate-env) template. It creates a scheduled Fargate task that will be initiated off of Amazon EventBridge rules either on a schedule or in response to an EventBridge event. The EventBridge event that you create can run one or more tasks in your cluster at specified times. Your scheduled event can be set to a specific interval (run every N minutes, hours, or days). Otherwise, for more complicated scheduling, you can use a cron expression. The [Schedule Expression](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-create-rule-schedule.html) can be specified using the schedule_expression input. For more information, see [Scheduled tasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/scheduled_tasks.html). The task can be configured to run in a Public or a Private subnet using the subnet_type parameter. Other properties like desired task count, task size (cpu/memory units), and docker image URL can be specified through the service input parameters. 

The template also provisions a CodePipeline based pipeline to pull your application source code before building and deploying it to the Proton service. To use sample application code, please fork the sample code repository [aws-proton-sample-services](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-proton-sample-services). By default, the template deploys a [python application](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-proton-sample-services/tree/main/ecs-ping-sns) that sends a random 5-letter string along with the Time to the shared SNS topic, every 5 minutes.
